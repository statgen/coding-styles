# UM Center for Statistical Genetics Perl Style Guideliness

We recommend using [PerlCritic](https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic) for
applying coding standards. By default it follow *Perl Best Practices* but we
can create our own local policies as they develop. A sample `.perlcriticrc`
is included here.

We also recommend [PerlTidy](https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Tidy) for code
formatting. A local `.perltidyrc` is included here.
